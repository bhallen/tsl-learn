MaxEnt approach: calculate weights for all constraints in the usual way. 
- prior will probably need to prefer restrictions on broader tiers?
- needs small l1 prior as well to get rid of extraneous constraints
- probably need to use k-fold CV to test

Some way to account for the fact that unattested != ungrammatical
- compare attested to counts predicted from segment distribution?

Information theoretic: ???
